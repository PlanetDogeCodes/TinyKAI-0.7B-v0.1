## Model Details
TinyKAI-0.7B is one of the world's SMALLEST "large" language models EVER!
We acheived such a feat by essentially compressing [GPT2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) and squeezing it to be UNDER 1 billion parameters!

## Uses
Due to being one of the tiniest "large" language models on huggingface, many corners had to be cut. TinyKAI-0.7B has a max output of only 150 characters (without repeating itself). Therefore, TinyKAI is only intended for research purposes.
<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->

## Banned Use
TinyKAI-1B is governed by the [apache 2.0 liscense](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/), and therefore means that whatever the license deems unacceptable shall not be allowed. We specificaly ban the use of  [ANY AND ALL KAI MODELS](https://huggingface.co/collections/Keynote-Technology/kai-large-language-models) for hate speech towards a paricular thing, person, our particular group due to [legal](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/06/ftc-report-warns-about-using-artificial-intelligence-combat-online-problems) and ethical issues.

## Limitations
100 characters max output length, English only, and extremely small.

## Recommendations
TinyKAI-0.7B is a very small model, and is good for AI research especially.
